Anything following a hash character (#) is a comment.

An OBJ file may contain vertex data, free-form curve/surface attributes, elements, free-form curve/surface body statements, connectivity between free-form surfaces, grouping and display/render attribute information.   The most common elements are geometric vertices, texture coordinates, vertex normals and polygonal faces:

```
 # List of geometric vertices, with (x, y, z [,w]) coordinates, w is optional and defaults to 1.0.
 v 0.123 0.234 0.345 1.0
 v ...
 ...
 # List of texture coordinates, in (u, [,v ,w]) coordinates, these will vary between 0 and 1. v, w are optional and default to 0.
 vt 0.500 1 [0]
 vt ...
 ...
 # List of vertex normals in (x,y,z) form; normals might not be [[Unit normal|unit vectors]].
 vn 0.707 0.000 0.707

### Geometric vertex

A [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] can be specified in a line starting with the letter `v`. That is followed by (x,y,z[,w]) coordinates. W is optional and defaults to 1.0. A right-hand coordinate system is used to specify the coordinate locations. Some applications support vertex colors, by putting red, green and blue values after x y and z.  The color values range from 0 to 1.

### Parameter space vertices

A free-form geometry statement can be specified in a line starting with the string `vp`. Define points in parameter space of a curve or surface. `u` only is required for curve points, `u` and `v` for surface points and control points of non-rational trimming curves, and `u`, `v` and `w` (weight) for control points of rational trimming curves.

### Face elements

Faces are defined using lists of vertex, texture and normal indices in the format vertex_index/texture_index/normal_index for which each index starts at 1 and increases corresponding to the order in which the referenced element was defined.  Polygons such as quadrilaterals can be defined by using more than three  indices.

OBJ files also support free-form geometry which use curves and surfaces to define objects, such as [[NURBS]] surfaces.

#### Vertex indices

A valid vertex index matches the corresponding vertex elements of a previously defined vertex list. 
If an index is positive then it refers to the offset in that vertex list, starting at 1.
If an index is negative then it relatively refers to the end of the vertex list, -1 referring to the last element.

Each face can contain three or more vertices.

```
 f v1 v2 v3 ....
```

#### Vertex texture coordinate indices

Optionally, texture coordinate indices can be used to specify texture coordinates when defining a face.
To add a texture coordinate index to a vertex index when defining a face,
one must put a slash immediately after the vertex index and then put the 
texture coordinate index.  No spaces are permitted before or after the slash.
A valid texture coordinate index starts from 1 and matches the corresponding
element in the previously defined list of texture coordinates. 
Each face can contain three or more elements.

```
 f v1/vt1 v2/vt2 v3/vt3 ...
```

#### Vertex normal indices

Optionally, normal indices can be used to specify normal vectors for vertices when defining a face.
To add a normal index to a vertex index when defining a face, 
one must put a second slash after the texture coordinate index and then put
the normal index.
A valid normal index starts from 1 and matches the corresponding element
in the previously defined list of normals.
Each face can contain three or more elements.

```
 f v1/vt1/vn1 v2/vt2/vn2 v3/vt3/vn3 ...
```

#### Vertex normal indices without texture coordinate indices
As texture coordinates are optional, one can define geometry without them, but
one must put two slashes after the vertex index before putting the normal index.

```
 f v1//vn1 v2//vn2 v3//vn3 ...
```

#### Line elements
Records starting with the letter "l" specify the order of the vertices which build a polyline.

```
 l v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 ...
```

### Other geometry formats

Obj files support higher-order surfaces using several different kinds of interpolation, such as Taylor and B-splines, although support for those features in third party file readers is far from universal. Obj files also do not support mesh hierarchies or any kind of animation or deformation, such as vertex skinning or mesh morphing.

### Referencing materials

[[Material (computer graphics)|Materials]] that describe the visual aspects of the polygons are stored in
external .mtl files.  More than one external MTL material file may be referenced from within the OBJ file.  The .mtl file may contain one or more named material definitions.

```
 mtllib [external .mtl file name]
 ...
```

This tag specifies the material name for the element following it. The material name matches a named material definition in an external .mtl file.

```
 usemtl [material name]
 ...
```

Named objects and polygon groups are specified via the following tags.

```
 o [object name]
   ...
   g [group name]
   ...
```

[[Smooth shading]] across polygons is enabled by smoothing groups.

```
 s 1
   ...
   # Smooth shading can be disabled as well.
   s off
   ...
```

### Relative and absolute indices

OBJ files, due to their list structure, are able to reference vertices, normals, etc. either by their absolute position (1 represents the first defined vertex, N representing the Nth defined vertex), or by their relative position (-1 represents the latest defined vertex). 
However, not all software supports the latter approach, and conversely some software inherently writes only the latter form (due to the convenience of appending elements without needing to recalculate vertex offsets, etc.), leading to occasional incompatibilities.
